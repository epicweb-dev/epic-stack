### CI safety checklist

- Run `npm run typecheck` after TypeScript changes.
- Run `npx prisma generate --sql` if Prisma SQL imports fail.
- Run `npm run test:e2e:run` for auth/session/permission changes.
- If a check cannot run due to environment limits, document the reason and
  avoid declaring the change ready without CI confirmation.
