# Monitoring

This document describes how to get [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) (the Epic
application monitoring provider) set up for error, performance, and replay
monitoring.

> **NOTE**: this is an optional step and only needed if you want monitoring in
> production.

## SaaS vs Self-Hosted

Sentry offers both a [SaaS solution](https://sentry.io/) and
[self-hosted solution](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/). This guide
assumes you are using SaaS but the guide still works with self-hosted with a few
modifications.

## Signup

You can sign up for Sentry and create a Remix project from visiting
[this url](https://sentry.io/signup/?project_platform=javascript-remix) and
filling out the signup form.

## Setting up the sentry-vite plugin

Once you see the onboarding page which has the DSN, copy that somewhere (this
becomes `SENTRY_DSN`). Now, set the sentry dsn secret in Fly.io to be used as an
env var during runtime:

```sh
fly secrets set SENTRY_DSN=<your_dsn>
```

See the guide for the remix
[here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/). Run the
installation wizard but note that some of the steps included already exist in
this codebase so be sure to remove any duplication.

To generate the auth token, click
[this](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/settings/:orgslug/developer-settings/new-internal/)
to create an internal integration (which grants the selected capabilities to the
recipient, similar to how RBAC works). Give it a name and add the scope for
`Releases:Admin` and `Organization:Read`. Press Save, find the auth token at the
bottom of the page under "Tokens", and copy that to secure location (this
becomes `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`). Then visit the organization settings page and copy
that organization slug (`SENTRY_ORG`), and the slug name for your project too
(`SENTRY_PROJECT`).

In the 'build' section of the [Dockerfile](../other/Dockerfile), there is an
example of how to pass (mount) the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` as a docker secret, so it
is available to Vite when `npm run build` is run. You can do the same for
`SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` or actually any other secret (environment
variable) you need at build time, just make sure those secrets (variables) are
available on the CI runner: see the 'deploy' job from
[`deploy`](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) workflow. Note that these do not
need to be added to the [`env.server`](../app/utils/env.server.ts) env vars
schema, as they are only used during the build and not the runtime.

The Sentry Vite plugin in [`vite.config.ts`](../vite.config.ts) will create
sentry releases for you and automatically associate commits during the vite
build once the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, which in our set-up is done via
[GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
In this setup we have utilized a simple strategy for naming releases of using
the commit sha, passed in as a build arg via the GitHub action workflow.
